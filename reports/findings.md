## Findings from the Visualizations

The visualizations show that the most prominent words in the data set have terms that are significantly connected to credible and scam messages. This reaffirms the determination of the discriminative linguistic patterns in the text data.

## Findings from the Base Model

- **F1 Score:** 0.9825 â€“ The model performs extremely well, especially for a traditional logistic regression model.

- **Confusion Matrix Values:**
- True Positives: 128
- True Negatives: 241
- False Positives: 7
- False Negatives: 1

These values show that the model performs very well at classifying most of the messages. The very low false negative rate shows great recall, suggesting the model is extremely good at picking out scam messages.
